# JavaScript Exercise: My Contacts
This app was created to explore concepts of classes and element creation using javaScript. In it, I experienced how to use setters and getters, HTML element creation (using html classes in JavaScript) and how to use arrays as a makeshift, temporary databse. 
## Features
- Users may enter inputs which are validated and then added on the screen
- Each contact can be deleted with trash icon in right corner
- Each contact can be emailed directed with the mail icon next to trash icron
- Total Contacts are limited by the array size 
- Total Contacts are counted
